# Tic-Tac-Toe
Here was a practice code I made in undergrad to familiarize myself with Java, this is a simulation of tic-tac-toe. In the folder that is named "code" is code I did in 2020 where the goal was to make Tic-Tac-Toe but by including AI so the game could actually try to beat you and stop you from winning as well (sort of like AI in chess applications). However, with my lack of knowledge in AI at that time, I was unsuccessful in implementing the AI but instead I just used the random library (which of course is no fun because you will easily be able to win) 

# Update
I updated this project by implementing GUI (for better gra[hics of course) and AI to the tic-tac-toe code (which is shown in the "src" folder). With the AI I will be implementing the "MiniMax" algorithm in order to achieve automation.
